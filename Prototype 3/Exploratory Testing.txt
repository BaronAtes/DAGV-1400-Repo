If the player is not on the ground for long enough, the jump animation is delayed and the running animation still plays while the player is in mid-air
The player can crash more than once if they collide with an object again after getting a game over
Challenge 3
	Balloon feels really heavy. Maybe change the gravity modifier?
	Player cannot control for a second or two after the game starts, but that could just be an issue with my computer
	Background starts slightly too far right, revealing a sliver of the default Unity background
